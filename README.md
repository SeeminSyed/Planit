Repository for a scalable Android app for an incubator startup in Toronto, Planit, built in Fall of 2019 using Flutter SDK and public APIs, hosted on UofT servers, for CSCC01 at the Dept. of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, University of Toronto.
This project has been forked from the original repo, which was hosted by the professor and has since been closed.
